# Characterizing Satellite Geometry via Accelerated 3D Gaussian Splatting

This repository contains the authors' implementation of the paper "Characterizing Satellite Geometry via Accelerated 3D Gaussian Splatting" ([MDPI Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/11/3/183)).

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/NEural-TransmissionS/Sat3DGS --recursive
cd Sat3DGS
./apply_patches.sh
```

Proceed to each submodule and follow their instructions to build 4 separated (suggested) environments for each submodule.
